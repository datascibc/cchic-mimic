## Who is the course for?

Clinicians involved with **audit**, **quality improvement** or **research**!

- If you're a clinician who has to wrangle a bit of data, and wish you could do it better.
- If you've ever written a formula in Excel that mysteriously broke.
- If you've hunted around for someone with a copy of SPSS to run a statistical test. 
- If you've ever groaned when someone said, "You'll need to ask a statistician".

## What special knowledge to I need?

**None!** No A-level maths. No coding experience.

You'll probably be someone who has collected some data in an Excel spreadsheet or similar. You already know about basic bar charts and scatter plots. You know how to calculate the mean, and have heard of the standard deviation (but can't remember how to calculate it).

You want to present your work either in a report or to your colleagues.

You're prepared to give up a few hours to learn a set of skills that you can use and re-use in the future.

## What happens on the course?

Each evening there are two mini-lectures for 15 minutes, each followed by a 40 minute practical session.

You'll start with an Excel sheet of data we provide. We'll show you better ways to lay it out, and how to validate data as you go along. Then you'll fire up the R statistics package (it's free), and import your data. We'll then give you a whistle-stop tour of how to do some basic statistical tests. Finally, we'll show you how to build a beautiful data visualisation.

At the end of the day, you'll go home with a working statistical software package on your own machine, the course guide, and a workflow that you can apply to your own data.

*We'll have a small team to help discuss your own projects during the coffee breaks.*

## What do I need to bring?

**You bring your laptop**, preloaded with the software you need for the course. We'll send you instructions on what you need and how to set it up, and can lend a hand if you get stuck.
