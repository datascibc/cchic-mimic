We are partly funded by the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk), and the [National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia](http://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides-everything/using-git-shared-folders-and-virtual-machines).

We have also been generously supported this year by [The Institution of Engineering and Technology](http://www.theiet.org/index.cfm?). The IET Healthcare Technologies Technical and Professional Network is a free to join technical community which brings together professionals either working or interested in biomedical engineering, including traditional engineering and technological disciplines, clinicians and healthcare professionals to exchange knowledge and develop ideas in this technical field.

For more information please visit www.theiet.org/health-tech.

We also run a regular programme of 'lab meetings' under the auspices of the ['Data Science Breakfast Club'](http://datascibc.org) then [get in contact](mailto:hello@datascibc.org). You may be pleased to know that the original breakfast meetings have now been replaced by a slightly more agreeable (for the night owls) tea party event.
